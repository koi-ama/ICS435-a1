# ICS435 Assignment 1 Execution Plan

## 1. Goal
- Complete Assignment 1 end-to-end with reproducible code, GitHub-ready repository, and a PDF report based on the provided template.
- Track progress using `tasksList.md` and detailed task tickets in `tasks/`.

## 2. Required Outputs
- ML implementation comparing KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest on `load_breast_cancer`.
- 80/20 train-test split and StandardScaler applied for KNN pipeline.
- Metrics for each model: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1.
- Confusion matrix for each model.
- Hyperparameter ablation for each model.
- Repository documentation and runnable scripts.
- Report (max 4 pages, font 10, single space) and PDF export.

## 3. Scope and Non-scope
- In scope:
  - Code implementation, experiment execution, figures/tables, report draft and PDF generation.
  - Submission checklist and final manual handoff for LMS.
- Out of scope:
  - Direct LMS submission (requires user login/session).

## 4. Work Strategy
- Use one reproducible script to run all experiments and save artifacts.
- Save all results under `outputs/` so report writing is deterministic.
- Keep report source in repo (`report/`) and export PDF from source.
- Update `tasksList.md` status after each completed task.

## 5. Milestones
1. Planning docs completed.
2. Reproducible ML pipeline implemented.
3. Experiments executed and artifacts generated.
4. Report completed and PDF exported.
5. Final checklist completed; only LMS click remains.

## 6. Risks and Mitigations
- Missing package versions:
  - Mitigation: define `requirements.txt` and verify in local run.
- PDF export tool unavailable:
  - Mitigation: keep report in Markdown and provide fallback conversion command.
- Runtime/result mismatch:
  - Mitigation: save exact metrics and confusion matrices generated by script.

## 7. Definition of Done
- All tasks in `tasksList.md` are `Done` except explicit manual LMS action.
- `README.md` contains run instructions and GitHub/report linkage.
- PDF exists in repository and matches template sections.
